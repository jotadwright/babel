# MUHAI Cookingbot

The MUHAI cookingbot is a system that can perform recipe execution tasks in simulation. Given a recipe in natural (human) language, it is able to understand the instructions of this recipe and take the appropriate actions to cook the intended dish. The actions are simulated using a qualitative simulation engine implemented in IRL.

The cookingbot has been developed by VUB and UNamur in the context of the European project [MUHAI](https://www.muhai.org) and received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 951846.

## Primitives

The primitive operations that the cookingbot can actually handle, can be found in the benchmark documentation available in the folder 'benchmark/documentation'. Extensions to these primitives can be made by modifying the 'primitives.lisp' file. However, this might also require modifications in the 'ontology.lisp' file if new ingredients or tools are introduced. 

## Initial Kitchen State
The initial kitchen state that is used in the simulator can be modified in the 'environments.lisp' file. Modifications in 'ontology.lisp' might be required in order to introduce new ingredients or tools.
