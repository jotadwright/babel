# MUHAI Cookingbot

The MUHAI cookingbot is a system that can perform recipe execution tasks in simulation. Given a recipe in natural (human) language, it is able to understand the instructions of this recipe and take the appropriate actions to cook the intended dish. The actions are simulated using a qualitative simulation engine implemented in IRL.

The cookingbot has been developed by VUB and UNamur in the context of the European project [MUHAI](https://www.muhai.org) and received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 951846.
