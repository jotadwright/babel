# CLEVR Evaluation

The CLEVR evaluation system defines all functions needed to evaluate the CLEVR Grammar, both sequentially and in parallel, on 3 different levels:

 1. Comprehension
 2. Comparing meaning networks to functional programs
 3. COmparing computed answers to ground-truth answers

It also defines and exports some utility functions that operate over IRL networks.

Finally, it contains the demo file that can be used to showcase the CLEVR grammar and evaluation.
