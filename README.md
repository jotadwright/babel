# Babel

_The all-in-one toolkit for multi-agent experiments on emergent communication!_

***

Babel is a flexible toolkit for implementing and running agent-based experiments on emergent communication. The Babel system includes advanced modules for constructional language processing and learning ([Fluid Construction Grammar](https://fcg-net.org)), conceptualising and interpreting procedural semantic structures (Incremental Recruitment Language), and conducting multi-agent experiments in simulated environments or using physical robots.

An extensive monitoring system opens up every detail of Babelâ€™s intermediate representations and underlying dynamics. A modular design ensures that the system can be used in a wide variety of scenarios. It is therefore possible to use each component individually, according to your needs.

Babel is written in Common Lisp and runs in most major Lisp implementations (CCL, SBCL and LispWorks) on all major platforms (Linux, Mac OS, Windows). It is jointly developed by [Sony Computer Science Laboratories Paris](https://csl.sony.fr/), [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://ehai.ai.vub.ac.be/), [KU Leuven](https://itec.kuleuven-kulak.be/) and [UNamur](https://www.unamur.be/info) under an Apache 2.0 license.

## Installation

If you only wish to use Fluid Construction Grammar or Incremental Recruitment Language, we offer a user-friendly alternative through the [FCG Editor](https://www.fcg-net.org/download/). The FCG Editor offers all functionality of Babel's Fluid Construction Grammar and Incremental Recruitment Language systems through a powerful integrated development environment that can be installed in a single click.

If you want the full Babel experience, detailed installation instructions for all major operating systems can be found on the [wiki](https://gitlab.ai.vub.ac.be/ehai/babel/-/wikis/home).

## Technical documentation

Technical documentation for the Babel architecture is available at [tech-doc](https://emergent-languages.org/tech-doc/).
