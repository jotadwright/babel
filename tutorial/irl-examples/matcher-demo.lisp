;; Flexible interpretation
;; Not blindly execute the FCG output as an IRL program
;; But, find a network that matches the FCG output that can be evaluated

;; How matching works
;; Matching is not the same thing as unification

;; 1 matching is needed for flexible interpretation
;; 2 the output of FCG is often incomplete
;; 3 it is matched against chunks
