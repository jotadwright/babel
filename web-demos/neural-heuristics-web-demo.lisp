  (add-element '((h3) "Summary"))
  (add-element '((p) "Constructionist approaches to language,  as originally laid out by, among others, Fillmore, Goldberg, Kay and Croft, consider form-meaning mappings,  called constructions,  to be the basic unit of linguistic analysis.  Apart from the fact that they constitute form-meaning mappings,  constructions are subject to very few restrictions.  First of all, constructions do not necessarily correspond to tree-building operations.  Second,  constructions are non-local in the sense that they can access all information that is known during processing.  Third,  constructions can involve units of arbitrary size,  both on the form and the meaning side.  Finally,  constructions  are not restricted to continuous constituents and are not even required to include word order constraints.  As a consequence,  constructional language processing cannot straightforwardly be implemented in a faithful way using common grammar processing techniques,  such as chart parsing and generation. Instead,  faithful computational construction grammar implementations implement constructional language processing as a state-space search problem."))

  (add-element '((p) "In order to reliably scale to large problems,  state-space search methods rely on heuristics that can estimate the likelihood that a given state will lead to a solution.  While certain optimizations have in the past been applied to the case of computational construction grammar,  including construction sets and priming networks,  a lack of general and powerful heuristics remained a major obstacle to ongoing construction grammar research, in particular to research on representing, processing and learning large-scale construction grammars."))

  (add-element '((p) "The neural methodology that we have presented in this paper introduces a general and efficacious way to learn heuristics that substantially optimize the search processes involved in constructional language processing.  Analogous to recent successes in many subfields of artificial intelligence, including game playing and planning,  the methodology combines the predictive strengths of neural networks with the expressive representations,  sound logic operations and backtracking abilities of traditional search and unification methods."))

  (add-element '((p) "An integration of the proposed method in the Fluid Construction Grammar system and an evaluation of the method using the CLEVR benchmark dataset and the CLEVR construction grammar showed that the neural heuristics indeed outperformed the state-of-the-art priming strategy and could substantially reduce the search space and processing time in both the comprehension and the production direction,  especially in the case of utterances that otherwise gave rise to a large search space."))

  (add-element '((p) "This general methodology for learning neural heuristics that optimize the search processes involved in constructional language processing constitutes a crucial contribution towards the scaling of constructionist approaches to language.  It thereby has both theoretical and practical implications. On the theoretical side,  scalable processing models will allow construction grammarians to go beyond the study of constructions in isolation,  and model the intricate interactions that take place between constructions as part of a larger grammar.  On the practical side, the scaling of constructional language processing paves the way for achieving breakthroughs in ongoing research on learning large-scale construction grammars, which has in turn major implications on research in usage-based linguistics, models of language acquisition and the use of construction grammar in language technology applications."))

After the initial application of a series of morphological and lexical constructions, the first split in the search tree occurs after node 15.

The algorithm then chooses to expand the first of the three children and to explore that branch in a depth-first manner."))

In that case, potential sister nodes of that node are explored, before we move higher up to aunts, great aunts, etc. You can follow the exact order in which the search tree was explored by inspecting the numbers that precede the label of every node. The first number is the node's id, reflecting the relative moment at which it was created, whereas the second number is the node's score, which is in the case of the depth-first search algorithm equal to the depth of the node in the tree. You can click on the '+' sign in the tree to unfold branches that contain duplicate nodes.

After the hashed constructions have been processed, starting from transient structure 16, the (comprehension) sequence-to-sequence model was queried every time a new transient structure needed to be expanded. Given the input utterance and the sequence of the names of constructions that already applied, our neural model returns the most likely construction to apply next, together with a probability score. The new transient structure that results from the application of the predicted construction receives a heuristic value, which is the sum of the mother's heuristic value and the probability score."))

Our sequence-to-sequence model learned that applying this construction even before all nominal constructions is indeed a good strategy to find a solution in a fast way.
