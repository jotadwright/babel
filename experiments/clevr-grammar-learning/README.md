# CLEVR Grammar Learning

## About

The CLEVR grammar learning experiment lets a learner agent learn a bi-directional grammar from scratch from corpus data, consisting of utterances with their IRL meaning representations.



## Usage

In order to run the experiment, you'll need to compile the ```start.lisp``` file and evaluate the ```run-training``` and ```run-evaluation``` functions.

## Configuration
All default values are defined in ```experiment.lisp``` 
The set of repairs that is used by the learner agent is defined in ```grammar.lisp``` .
