# Ontology alignment package

## What is it? 

This package contains elements to lead an experiment regarding ontology alignement on a language level. It uses a population of 3 agents, each having access to its own database. The aim for them is :
1) to learn a query language (at the moment, this query language is SQL)
2) to build an emergent language allowing them to exchange informations from their respective database
This exchange of informations can therefore take place without the need of an ontology alignement per se. The alignment exists in the emergent language allowing the agents to communicate and share informations from databases that don't necessarily have the same structure nor the same query language.
