;;;; Jens - 04/01/2024
;;;; The global variable *alpahbet* is implemented as a circular list
;;;; by having the cdr of the last cons-cell in the list point to the
;;;; start of the list instead of to NIL. This allows to cycle through
;;;; the alphabet by each time calling 'pop'. However, this makes it
;;;; impossible to print the variable *alphabet* (as it would be
;;;; infinitely long). So do not try this, unless you want LispWorks
;;;; to be blocked...
;;;; You _can_ print *alphabet* when setting the system variable
;;;; *print-circle* to T, but this has other effects that are not
;;;; desirable. For instance, the predicate (F ?B ?B) would be printed
;;;; as (F #1=?B #1#).
