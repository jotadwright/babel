# Pattern Finding

## Repairs

Repairs are applied in the reverse order as reported here.

### **1. Nothing -> Holistic**

Make a holistic construction of whatever form and meaning is left. `form-args` and `meaning-args` for the contributing part of the construction can be passed along from the recursion of repairs.

### **2. Anti-unify cxns**

### **3. Anti-unify ts**

### **4. Add Categorial Links**

Add categorial links between grammatical categories of constructions that already cover the observation. 

  1. _Run comprehension without categorial links._ 
  2. _Reject incompatible solution._ Remove solution nodes where the top level `form-args` and `meaning-args` in the transient structure do not correspond to the unconnected variables of the observed form and meaning. 
  3. _Extract categorial links._ From the solution node, extract categorial links.

**Questions:**

  - Step 2 is now only done on the meaning side. Should also be done on the form side.
