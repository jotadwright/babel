# seq2seq-heuristics

Seq2seq-heuristics is a Babel subsystem for integrating seq2seq heuristics in Fluid Construction Grammar. It loads its functionalities into the FCG package.

For using the system, set the following entries in the configuration of your construction inventory:

- `(:lstm-endpoint . "<url>")`
- `(:lstm-model-comprehension "<model>")`
- `(:lstm-model-formulation "<model>")`
