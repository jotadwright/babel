# Installation

This document contains the steps required to install and configure the third version of the Flask server for the Nao robot.

Improvements in this version:

 - Docker is no longer required. The latest version of the `naoqi` Python SDK (v. 2.8) seems to run directly on mac OS.
 - The vision system is much improved. We now use Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art neural network model for object detection and segmentation. This particular variant was pretrained on CLEVR images.

## Step 1: Install Python 2

## Step 2: Install Python packages

## Step 3: Download the pretrained weights for Mask R-CNN

## Step 4: Configure Mask R-CNN
